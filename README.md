# Disk Temperature Package

This is a package for a simple temperature estimates in protoplanetary disks. It includes a class `tmid` to estimate the mid-plane temperature, `pmstracks` to download and interpolate the Siess et al. 2000 PMS evolutionary tracks. It also includes some *yet unfinished* code for gas opacities.
